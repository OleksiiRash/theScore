## **Rationale for Testing Approach:**

**Data-Driven Testing (DDT) and Page Object Model (POM):** 

These methodologies were selected for their effectiveness in creating a scalable and maintainable test framework. DDT enables the framework to be flexible and applicable to a range of test data, while POM helps in organizing the code structure, making it more readable and easier to maintain.

**Cucumber:** 

This was implemented for its ability to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, making test scenarios understandable as living documentation.
Appium and Java: The combination was chosen for their robustness and wide acceptance in mobile application automation, along with their strong community support.

**Framework Choices:**

**Appium:** Selected for its capability to automate across different mobile platforms, providing a comprehensive testing solution for mobile applications.

**Java:** Known for its stability and integration with numerous testing libraries, making it a reliable choice for building a test automation framework.

**Cucumber:** Facilitates Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), enhancing the clarity and business alignment of test cases.

## **Feature Coverage:**

The test suite focuses on key functionalities as specified in the test automation task, without aiming for exhaustive coverage of the appâ€™s features. 

Two feature files were created, adhering to the requirements of the coding technical interview, demonstrating the ability to set up a framework from scratch and emphasizing the structure and coverage of main test scenarios.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

The primary challenge was to demonstrate the capability of setting up a test framework from scratch, showing its structure and potential for future expansion. The current scope was intentionally limited to the main tests required in the coding technical interview, rather than covering a comprehensive range of functionalities.

**Future Enhancements:**

The framework, in its current state, showcases the foundational setup and execution of critical test cases. While it does not cover all functionalities of the app, it is structured for easy scalability and inclusion of additional test cases in the future.

**Test Suite Expansion:** Future enhancements could involve the addition of more feature files to cover a broader spectrum of app functionalities.

**Continuous Integration:** Plans include integrating the framework into a CI/CD pipeline for automated test execution.

**Cross-Device Testing:** Extending the test coverage across various devices and OS versions to ensure broader compatibility.
